❝ the 3 most powerfull words in english language are : I DONT KNOW
when you say those words, you really upon yourself to learning ❞

❝ one of the big first steps in learning a language is you understand what is being said and
then you use the words that might not be coming to you, but then somebody is like, oh yeah, they
tell you. ❞

❝ But I also believe in.
Like.
The importance of sharing our humanity and, you know, there's a time and place for everything but
the teacher student relationships and the awesome relationship and some way life is funny and, you
know, you don't share all of it.
And that's right on the edge.
But but definitely some of it is worth sharing because if we can't talk honestly about what it means
to be human and the different challenges we face, if we don't have someplace where we could share that
both with our friends and family, but also just, you know, in a learning environment, I think it's
a disservice to all of us if we aren't able to do that. ❞
