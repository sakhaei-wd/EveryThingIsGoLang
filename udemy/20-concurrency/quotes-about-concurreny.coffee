And when you when you work with concurrent code, 
you really kind of have to think about this dance.
You got to think about a dance where many different 
things are happening at once and you're starting
to orchestrate and coordinate all those different things that happen.
So you might think of a dance with many things happening on the dance floor, 
or you might think of a conductor in front of an orchestra who's like, 
you know, setting the pace 
for the entire program, for the entire group and occasionally point things out and 
occasionally tell them things to hold and wait for a second and then bring things up.


نشخوارهای ذهنی تو گوروتین هایی هستند که تو رو آزار میدن
و تو باید جلوشون رو بگیری
چرا که همزمان که داری کار میکنی توی ذهنت دارن پیش میرن و فعالیت میکنن
و نتیجه های مختلفی رو بیرون میدن که توی حس و حالت بروز پیدا میکنه
