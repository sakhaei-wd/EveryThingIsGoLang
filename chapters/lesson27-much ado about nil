//what's nill ? =====================
The word nil is a noun that means nothing or zero. In the Go programming language,
nil is a zero value

Many programming languages incorporate the concept of nil, though they may call it
NULL, null, or None.


//Nil leads to panic: =====================
var nowhere *int
fmt.Println(nowhere)		//prints <nil>
fmt.Println(*nowhere)		//panic : nil pointer dereference (error)

//=========================================
To be fair, programs can crash for many reasons, not only because of nil pointer dereferences.
For example, divide by zero also causes a panic, and the remedy is similar

// nill receivers =========================
func main() {
	var nobody *person
	fmt.Print(nobody)		//Prints <nil>
	nobody.birthday()
}

type person struct {
	age int			
}

func (p *person) birthday() {
	p.age++				   //nil pointer dereference
}
